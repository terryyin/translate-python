# <terry.yinzhe@gmail.com> wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
# can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
# this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return to Terry Yin.
#
# The idea of this is borrowed from <mort.yao@gmail.com>'s brilliant work
#    https://github.com/soimort/google-translate-cli
# He uses "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE". That's why I use it too. So you can buy him a 
# beer too.
